# Course Prerequisite Finder
When planning courses to take in college, many courses have prerequisite courses which must be taken beforehand. It is left up to the student to plan out their courses. This can leave a student overwhelmed at which courses they must take in which order since, very often, prerequisite courses have their own prerequisite courses. This can become a disaster very quickly. The Course Prerequisite Finder tool aids in finding all the courses that a student must take before they can take a desired course. It helps the student visually see how the courses relate to one another and can make more informed decisions while planning their college course schedule.
